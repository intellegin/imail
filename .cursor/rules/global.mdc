# High-level Guidelines

1. **Follow our naming & casing conventions** (directories, files, components, hooks, etc.).
2. **Keep feature code isolated** under `web/src/features/` and only promote to global components when truly shared.
3. **Route/page components** must end with `Page` (e.g. `DashboardPage.tsx`).
4. **shadcn/ui components** live exclusively in `web/src/components/ui` and are autogenerated – never hand-edit or lint-fix these files.
5. **Linting** – always run `pnpm lint:fix` before pushing. The `ui` directory is excluded from linting.
6. **Tailwind CSS** is our styling system; use the design tokens already defined.
7. **Environment variables** exposed to the client must be prefixed with `VITE_` and defined in `web/.env` (see `@web/env.example`).
8. **Type safety** – prefer `zod` schemas for validation, keep them close to the feature that uses them.
